# Design

This document outlines the design process of Shai-lang. This is different from [LANGUAGE.md](./LANGUAGE.md), which outlines the language syntax and grammar. This is documentation of the design process when it came to creating the language itself.

## Outlining the use case for the language

TODO: 

- Outline the need for a simpler scripting language that matched other languages.
- Outline the inspirations from other languages.
