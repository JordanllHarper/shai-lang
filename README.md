# SHAI

Shai is an interpreted scripting language built in Rust.

It aims to be simple, familiar and to get out of your way when building scripts, to prevent context switching.

It also includes features such as optional type annotations for asserting types at runtime, first class functions.

It is currently a WIP, but there is a fibonacci example as to what the language looks like [here](./example.shai).


## Building the interpreter

The language uses the Programming language [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as the runtime, follow the installation instructions there.
