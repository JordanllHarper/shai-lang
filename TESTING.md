# Testing

This document outlines the testing methodologies used in Shai-Lang. These will be used to measure how effective the project has been implemented.

## Technical

Shai Lang will have 2 types of technical tests:

- Unit 
- Integration

Unit tests will be implemented for single units of functionality. e.g. testing a syntax tree is parsed correctly. These can be run with:

```cargo test```

in the terminal

Integration tests will outline a general workflow for a developer building a simple script in Shai. These tests have not been formalized yet, as there is probably some framework or tooling I can use to implement these correctly.
